This will be lengthy notebook with no code just me extracting parts of the series of aricles from this first link.

# The start of this is [A Brief Introduction to Computational Neuroscience Part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-computational-neuroscience-part-1-42171791f613)

## I'll use this cell for notes as I read through the article

The Hubel and Wiesel Experiment was the first experiment leading to the start of neuroscience and led to where we are now. 

"The electrical and chemical signals recorded in the cells connecting the retina to the brain were converted to sound signals. These sound signals were then played, which resulted in ‘Snap! Pop!’ crackling sounds. These weren’t continuous, instead played only when the neuron fired. Henceforth, it has established a fundamental understanding of how neurons extract the information cast by the retina, and then clearly explained how the visual cortical neurons (present in the primary visual cortex, V1, in the brain) can formulate an image."

another view of the visual cortex

"The primary visual cortex is sometimes also called the striate cortex due to the presence of a large band of myelinated axons that runs along the eges of the calcarine sulcus."

This is a gif showing what the difference is between myelinated axons and non-myelinated axons and apparently all the neural connections for visual processing have them myelinated.
