# Some_NeuroSCi
This will be lengthy notebook with no code just me extracting parts of the series of aricles from this first link. Double quotes means I used the text from the article.

# The article I'm summarizing [A Brief Introduction to Computational Neuroscience](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-computational-neuroscience-part-1-42171791f613)

## I'll use this cell for notes as I read through the article

The Hubel and Wiesel Experiment was the first experiment leading to the start of neuroscience and led to where we are now. 

"The electrical and chemical signals recorded in the cells connecting the retina to the brain were converted to sound signals. These sound signals were then played, which resulted in ‘Snap! Pop!’ crackling sounds. These weren’t continuous, instead played only when the neuron fired. Henceforth, it has established a fundamental understanding of how neurons extract the information cast by the retina, and then clearly explained how the visual cortical neurons (present in the primary visual cortex, V1, in the brain) can formulate an image."

another view of the visual cortex

"The primary visual cortex is sometimes also called the striate cortex due to the presence of a large band of myelinated axons that runs along the eges of the calcarine sulcus."

This is a gif showing what the difference is between myelinated axons and non-myelinated axons and apparently all the neural connections for visual processing have them myelinated.

"A neuron consists of three main parts namely Soma, Dendrites, and Axon. Soma is the cell body. Dendrites are the input ends of the neurons whereas the axon is the output end." "the input is received by the dendrites from the axons of the adjacent neuron."

Interestingly, neurons can be defined as a “leaky bag of charged liquid.” So, all of a sudden, how have chemicals cropped up? It’s a crucial thing which many of us aren’t aware of. Neurons deal entirely with chemicals, and chemical reactions drive all the spikes and synapses. We indeed have [Na+, Cl-, K+, et al](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2019.00058/full) in our brains. Fascinating, isn’t it?


Neuronal signaling

"Voltage-Gated — Probability of opening the channel depends on membrane voltage.
Chemically Gated — Binding to a chemical causes the channel to open.
Mechanically Gated — Pressure or stretch influences the channel to open/close."

These next cells wrap up the article I left the Neuronal signaling to read without me sumarizing it on this notebook. 

"Descriptive Models: This model answers the question “What are the neuronal responses to external stimuli?” They review large amounts of experimental data, thereby characterizing what neurons and neural circuits do. These models may be based loosely on Biophysical, Anatomical, and Physiological findings, but their primary purpose is to describe phenomena, not to explain them.
The two main properties of descriptive models are,
They define qualitatively how to describe a scene or data by Neural Encoding.
They also define how we can extract information from neurons by Neural Decoding techniques."

"Mechanistic Models: Mechanistic models, on the other hand, address the question of “How nervous systems operate by known anatomy, physiology, and circuitry”. Such models often form a bridge among descriptive models at different levels.
The two main properties of mechanistic models are,
How can we simulate the behaviour of a single neuron on a computer?
How do we simulate a network of neurons?"

"Interpretive Models: These use computational and information-theoretic principles to explore the behavioral and cognitive significance of various aspects of nervous system functionality, addressing the question of “Why nervous systems operate as they do”.
The two main properties of interpretive models are,
Why do brains operate the way they do?
What are the computational principles underlying them?"

This was at the beginning of the main article but I want to end this with that.

"The human brain is incredible. Here visualized are 3% of the neurons and 0.0001% of the synapses in the brain, constituting part of the brain’s Thalamocortical system. Visualization via DigiCortex Engine."
