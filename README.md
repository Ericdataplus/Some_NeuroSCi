# Some_NeuroSCi

# The start of this is [A Brief Introduction to Computational Neuroscience Part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-computational-neuroscience-part-1-42171791f613)

This is the beginning of my computational neuroscience journey this is my prep work for Neuralink.

I don't know what's in store for me but need to start this asap so this is the start, I don't need anything other than what I have now to start learning neuroscience seriously.

All I know right now is at Neuralink the data is neural spikes. 

Another data source to get more to work with in to learn is mri data from open fmri.



## I will be writing notes as I go through the first article linked above.

The first experiment leading to the start of neuroscience and led to where we are now. 

"The electrical and chemical signals recorded in the cells connecting the retina to the brain were converted to sound signals. These sound signals were then played, which resulted in ‘Snap! Pop!’ crackling sounds. These weren’t continuous, instead played only when the neuron fired. Henceforth, it has established a fundamental understanding of how neurons extract the information cast by the retina, and then clearly explained how the visual cortical neurons (present in the primary visual cortex, V1, in the brain) can formulate an image."

[Another Article to look at](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Primary-visual-cortex-V1-neurons-receive-diverse-inputs-a-A-V1-neuron-can-receive_fig2_235333200)

another view of the visual cortex

"The primary visual cortex is sometimes also called the striate cortex due to the presence of a large band of myelinated axons that runs along the eges of the calcarine sulcus."
